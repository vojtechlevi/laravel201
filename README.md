# laravel201
Building an application using laravel with tailwind styling. 
We have built an application that lets the user add their cars to the database and then load them, make changes to them and remove them.
The scope of use for the application could be in a setting of a premium parking app, or perhaps in a settings of a more premium holding facility of premium cars in urban high density citys where there are scarse parking possibilities. 

The user creates an account with their email, and can registers as many cars as they want. Each user can only load the cars they have registred on their account.
